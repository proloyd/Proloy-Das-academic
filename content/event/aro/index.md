Listening to continuous speech induces an ongoing auditory cortical response, time-locked to certain features of speech, such as the acoustic envelope. This has been previously characterized by the Temporal Response Function (TRF), at the MEG/EEG sensor level. To probe into the cortical origins of such neural responses, we introduce Neuro-Current Response Functions, sparsely distributed throughout the cortex, that predict the cortical currents giving rise to the observed MEG/EEG data in response to continuous speech. We present a fast estimation algorithm and demonstrate its utility through application to simulated and real MEG data under auditory experiments.
